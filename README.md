# AutonomousAJ's Fake Store API Project

## Description
This project interfaces with the Fake Store API, offering a simulated environment for accessing and managing a variety of fake products, categories, and user data. It's ideal for developers looking to test e-commerce functionalities, data handling, or UI/UX designs without the need for a real product database.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, there are no specific prerequisites as the Fake Store API is public and does not require authentication.

## Using the Fake Store API
The Fake Store API is a public API that requires no authentication. You can directly make requests to the API endpoints. For detailed documentation on the available endpoints and data format, visit [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autonomousAJ_fakeStoreAPI.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd autonomousAJ_fakeStoreAPI`
3. Install dependencies (if any): `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Run the main script from the command line to interact with the Fake Store API:

`python main.py`

The script can be configured to make various API calls to retrieve product data, user information, or perform actions like adding, updating, and deleting products.

## Features
- Retrieve product lists and detailed product information
- Access and manage user data
- Simulate e-commerce transactions
- Modular and extendable codebase for various testing purposes
